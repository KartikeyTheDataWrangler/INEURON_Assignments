EOFError: This error is raised when a built-in function like input() or a file reading operation reaches the end of the file, but further data is expected.

It can occur when performing calculations involving floating-point numbers, such as division by zero or attempting to calculate the square root of a negative number.\n\nc. IndexError: This error is raised when an index is out of range in a sequence (e.g., list, string, tuple). It occurs when you try to access an element using an invalid index that is either too large or too small.\n\nd. MemoryError: This error is raised when the computer's memory allocation fails. It typically occurs when a program tries to allocate more memory than the system can provide. This error indicates that there is insufficient memory available to perform the requested operation.\n\ne. OverflowError: This error is raised when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for a numeric type. It occurs when performing calculations that produce a value outside the range of values that can be stored in the given data type.\n\nf. TabError: This error is raised when there is an issue with the indentation in Python code. It occurs when inconsistent use of tabs and spaces is encountered, typically within the same block of code.\n\ng.
